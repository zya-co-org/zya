Found in every living cell, these biological catalysts drive essential chemical reactions that sustain life—from helping plants turn CO₂ into oxygen to breaking down food in the human digestive system. But enzymes aren’t just important in nature; they’ve played a key role in food production throughout history.\n\nWhat started as a natural fermentation process used in ancient brewing and baking has now evolved into a cutting-edge tool for nutrition enhancement, food preservation, and health innovation. Today, enzymes are at the forefront of food science, helping manufacturers create better, healthier, and more sustainable products.\n\nIn this deep dive, we’ll explore how enzymes have shaped the food industry, highlight some of the most important enzymes in food production, and explain why innovations like [Convero](/convero) are setting the stage for a nutritional revolution.\n\n<customImage image=\"/media/Blur Ivan Rohovchenko.webp\" widthDesktop={10} caption=\"Did you know that amylase enzymes are responsible for the creation of alcohol? That’s right, there would be no beer or wine without the power of enzymes!\" widthMobile={8} marginBottom={0.5} marginTop={0.5} />\n\n## The History of Enzymes in Food Production\n\nThe use of enzymes in food dates back thousands of years. Long before people understood biochemistry, they were unknowingly harnessing enzyme activity through fermentation—brewing beer, making cheese, and baking bread with the help of wild yeasts and bacteria.\n\nOne of the earliest scientific discoveries in enzyme use came in 1878, when German physiologist Wilhelm Kühne first coined the term \"enzyme\" (from the Greek enzymos, meaning \"leavened\"). This was followed by breakthroughs in the early 1900s, when scientists began to isolate and study individual enzymes, unlocking their potential for food production.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, enzyme technology took off commercially, leading to industrial applications in baking, dairy, brewing, and food preservation. Fast forward to today, and enzymes are used in almost every corner of the food industry—improving taste, texture, shelf life, and nutritional value.\n\nBut what makes enzymes so special? Let’s take a look at some of the most widely used enzymes in food production today.\n\n## Enzymes in Action – The Science Behind Your Food\n\nEnzymes play a critical role in food transformation. Unlike artificial additives, they work in harmony with natural biological processes, making them a sustainable and consumer-friendly alternative to chemical interventions.\n\nHere are some of the most important enzymes used in the food industry today:\n\n<customImage image=\"/media/2.webp\" widthDesktop={10} widthMobile={8} />\n\n### Lactase – Making Dairy More Digestible\n\nFor the 65% of the world’s population who are [lactose intolerant](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/lactose-intolerance/#:~\\:text=Approximately%2065%20percent%20of%20the,people%20affected%20in%20these%20communities.), dairy can be a challenge. That’s where lactase comes in. This enzyme breaks down lactose, the sugar found in milk, into simpler sugars (glucose and galactose), making dairy products easier to digest.\n\nLactase is widely used to produce lactose-free milk, yogurt, and ice cream, allowing more people to enjoy dairy without discomfort. It’s a perfect example of how enzymes can make food more accessible and inclusive for consumers.\n\n➡️ National Center for Biotechnology Information –[ Read more about lactase here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5956270/).\n\n### Glucose Oxidase – A Natural Preservative\n\nWant to keep bread fresher for longer? [Glucose oxidase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/glucose-oxidase#:~\\:text=1%20Glucose%20oxidase%20\\(EC%201.1,et%20al.%2C%202015\\).) is the answer. This enzyme prevents spoilage by removing oxygen from food, creating a less favorable environment for mold and bacteria to grow.\n\nIn baking, glucose oxidase strengthens gluten structure, improving dough elasticity and volume. It’s also used in egg preservation, extending shelf life naturally without artificial preservatives.\n\n<customImage image=\"/media/3.webp\" widthDesktop={10} widthMobile={8} />\n\n### Amylase – The Secret to Softer Bread\n\nEver wonder why some bread stays soft and fresh longer? That’s thanks to amylase, an enzyme that breaks down starch into sugars, improving texture and moisture retention, it even leads to better toast!\n\nAmylase is a key player in baking, brewing, and even baby food production, helping to create smooth and digestible products. Without amylase, many of our favorite foods wouldn’t have the same appealing texture and taste.\n\n➡️ [Learn more about amylase](https://bakerpedia.com/ingredients/amylase/).\n\n<customImage image=\"/media/4.webp\" caption=\"Can’t get enough of that gooey, creamy center in chocolate-covered cherries? We have Invertase to thank!\" widthDesktop={10} widthMobile={8} />\n\n### Invertase – The Magic Behind Chocolate-Covered Cherries\n\nInvertase is an enzyme that breaks sucrose (table sugar) into glucose and fructose, creating a smoother and more soluble sweetener.\n\nIt’s widely used in candy-making to give chocolates a soft, creamy center, as well as in baked goods to help retain moisture and prevent crystallization.\n\nIf you’ve ever enjoyed a chocolate-covered cherry with a liquid filling, you’ve experienced the work of invertase!\n\n### Lysozyme – The Natural Antibacterial Enzyme\n\nFound naturally in egg whites, tears, and saliva, lysozyme is an enzyme with powerful antibacterial properties. It’s used in the food industry to prevent spoilage and extend shelf life—particularly in cheese, wine, and meat products.\n\nBecause lysozyme is a natural alternative to chemical preservatives, it appeals to health-conscious consumers looking for cleaner ingredient labels.\n\n<customImage image=\"/media/5.webp\" widthDesktop={10} widthMobile={8} />\n\n### Lipase – Enhancing Flavor and Texture in Dairy\n\nLipase enzymes are essential for developing the rich, complex flavors of aged cheeses like Parmesan and Roquefort. They break down fats into free fatty acids, contributing to aroma, texture, and taste.\n\nLipases are also used in low-fat dairy production, helping to retain the creamy mouthfeel of full-fat products while reducing overall fat content.\n\n### Pectinase – Juice Extraction Made Easy\n\nPectinase is the enzyme responsible for making fruit juices clearer and more concentrated. It breaks down pectin, a natural fiber found in fruit, allowing for easier juice extraction.\n\nWithout pectinase, orange juice would be cloudy, and wine production would be far less efficient. It’s an essential tool in fruit processing and beverage manufacturing.\n\nLearn more about the use of [pectinase in wine making](https://www.murphyandson.co.uk/enzymes-guest-blogger-lallemand-oenology/).\n\n### Protease – The Key to Tender Meat\n\nProteases break down proteins into amino acids, making them essential for meat tenderization and cheese production. They are used in marinades to soften tough cuts of meat and in dairy to help coagulate milk for cheese-making. [Fish sauce](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/food-science/fish-sauce) is an example of a popular condiment that uses protease enzymes.\n\nProteases are also used in plant-based meat alternatives to create improved texture and protein structures, making them an exciting tool in the rise of alternative proteins.\n\n<customImage image=\"/media/6.webp\" widthDesktop={10} widthMobile={8} />\n\n### Catalase: The Enzyme Behind Coffee Processing\n\nCatalase is a powerful enzyme found in nearly all living organisms, where it plays a crucial role in protecting cells by breaking down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. This rapid reaction—catalyzing millions of transformations per second—prevents oxidative damage, making catalase an essential part of biological defense systems.\n\nBut beyond its natural function, catalase is also used in the food and beverage industry, including in coffee processing, where it helps improve flavor, shelf life, and sustainability.\n\n#### How Catalase is Used in Coffee Processing\n\nCoffee beans undergo several stages of preparation before they become the aromatic brew we love. Catalase plays a role in refining and enhancing coffee in the following ways:\n\n1. Decaffeination Process – Some decaffeination methods use hydrogen peroxide as part of the caffeine extraction process. Catalase helps break down excess hydrogen peroxide, ensuring cleaner, chemical-free beans.\n2. Reducing Oxygen Exposure – Oxidation can degrade coffee quality, leading to stale or off-flavors. Catalase helps control oxygen levels in coffee processing, protecting delicate flavor compounds and extending shelf life.\n3. Fermentation Enhancement – Some specialty coffee producers use enzymatic fermentation to refine flavor. Catalase can aid in this process by regulating oxidative reactions, ensuring more consistent, high-quality beans.\n\nWith its natural ability to control oxidation, catalase is a valuable tool in producing better-tasting, longer-lasting coffee without the need for artificial additives. As enzyme technology continues to evolve, catalase remains a key player in improving coffee production and elevating the quality of every cup.\_\n\nAs we can see, the use of enzymes inis food production is both extensive and multi-purposed. From soft bread to lactose-free milk, enzymes (link to enzymes page) are the hidden heroes of food innovation. As consumer demand for healthier, more natural products grows, enzyme technology will continue to revolutionize the way we eat—bringing better nutrition, improved sustainability, and enhanced food experiences for all.\n\n<customImage image=\"/media/7.webp\" />\n\n## The Future of Enzyme Innovation – How Zya is Leading the Way\n\nWhile enzymes have been transforming food throughout human history, we’re just beginning to unlock their full potential. At Zya, we’re pioneering the next evolution of enzyme technology with Convero (link to Convero page), a breakthrough enzyme that converts sugar into fiber during digestion—helping to reduce sugar intake naturally without altering taste.\n\nInstead of altering the sugar content of food before consumption, Convero works inside the digestive system, selectively converting up to 30% of sucrose (table sugar) into inulin, a prebiotic dietary fiber.\n\nHere’s how it happens:\n\n1. Enzyme Activation – When food containing sugar reaches the digestive system, Convero is activated in the gut.\n2. Sucrose Breakdown & Reassembly – Instead of breaking sucrose into glucose and fructose (which the body quickly absorbs as sugar), Convero redirects part of the sucrose molecules and links them together into longer chains, forming inulin fiber.\n3. Fiber Formation & Gut Health Benefits – Because inulin is a non-digestible fiber, it bypasses sugar absorption, reducing overall sugar uptake while also feeding beneficial gut bacteria, improving digestive health.\n\nUnlike artificial sweeteners or sugar substitutes, Convero allows food to taste exactly the same while naturally reducing sugar’s impact on the body. This breakthrough approach enables people to enjoy their favorite foods while passively increasing fiber intake and promoting better long-term health—without making drastic dietary changes.\_\n\nThis next-generation enzyme is proof that bioscience can create real, impactful change in nutrition. With enzymes like Convero, we’re entering a new era where food doesn’t just taste great—it actively works to improve health.\n\nWant to learn more?
