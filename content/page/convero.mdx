          It’s clear from the issues discussed above that sugar substitutes
          leave much to desire, both in terms of perception and taste, as
          evidenced by shifting consumer preferences. That’s why at Zya, we take
          a different approach.


          Let's rethink sugar—not by substituting it, but by transforming how
          our body processes it, for a better and happier outcome, using the
          power of enzymes to convert sugar after consumption.

The enzyme is tailored to function effectively in the gastrointestinal tract, maintaining stability and performance.\n"

          When consumed, Convero acts on the sucrose you ingest, using its
          subunits (glucose and fructose) to form inulin. This type of fiber is
          well-tolerated by the human body and supports gut health by feeding
          beneficial bacteria.
