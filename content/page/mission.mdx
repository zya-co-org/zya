          Our enzyme, Convero, changes the way sugar interacts with the body by
          converting 30% of consumed sugar into dietary fiber. This results in
          less sugar uptake and fiber intake that feeds the microbiome.

          When restricted from eating a specific food, people tend to overeat it
          later — by 133%. 71% of Brits who tried a fad diet did not achieve
          their weight loss goals.


          In other words, if you want lasting change, you need to change the way
          food is digested, instead of expecting people to make dietary changes
          that impact the foods they eat or how their favourite foods taste.
