          Our enzyme, Convero, changes the way sugar interacts with the body by
          converting 30% of consumed sugar into dietary fiber. This results in
          less sugar uptake and fiber intake that feeds the microbiome.

          #### Taste-first approach for real lasting impact:


          ## Why taste and habits matter


          Did you know that 90% of consumers rank taste as their top purchase
          motivator? That’s why, at Zya, we prioritise transforming how food is
          digested—without ever compromising on taste.


          After all, taste matters.  It’s one of the biggest reasons why 95% of
          people struggle to stick to new dietary habits.  And sometimes, when
          restricted from eating a specific food, people tend to overeat it
          later - by 133%.

          At Zya, we want to make it much easier for people to stick to better
          choices, so that we can make lasting nutritional changes in their
          lives.


          We don’t want to just expect people to make dietary changes, we want
          to encourage and empower them.


          We believe that enzymes are the key to making sustainable impact, by
          enhancing the nutritional value of foods post-consumption with no
          taste compromise.
