      #### The status quo


      ## From chemical modification...


      The conventional approach to improving nutrition in processed food focuses
      on reformulated recipes and substituted ingredients.


      The result is: unsatisfying food that just does not taste as good.
    heroContentTwo: >
      #### The Zya way


      ## ...to biological transformation.


      With Zya, what you eat is just the start of the story.


      With the help of naturally-derived enzymes, we can enjoy food we love
      while achieving better nutritional outcomes - after we’ve eaten it.

      #### Our first ingredient - Convero


      ## Now with Convero: from Sugar to Fiber


      We discovered an enzyme with remarkable power: [Convero](/convero). This
      innovative enzyme converts 30% of sugar into dietary fiber in the gut.
      That’s less ‘bad’ and more ‘good for all of us.

            Niels firmly believes that science is a team sport. During his PhD
            at the University of Oxford he worked on functional proteins in the
            gut and became fascinated by the outsized impact of tiny molecular
            changes. At Zya, Niels leads the R\&D program and coordinates Zya’s
            research partners.
