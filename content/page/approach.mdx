          #### Enzymes are natural, powerful, and necessary.


          Enzymes occur naturally and play vital roles in our bodies, from
          breaking down food during digestion to resetting synapses for movement
          and brain function. They’re also essential in nature, for example by
          helping plants turn CO2 into food.
